# Geovisualisation
The comic [](#catprox) is a visualization of the relationship between human proximity to cat and the intelligence of the person.

Visualization is .mark[the process of representing data or information] in a graphical or pictorial form to communicate an idea, concept, or pattern more effectively.

## General purpose map
**General purpose map** (e.g., [](#topomap)) is mainly for wayfinding and navigation, as it displays a wide range of geographical features such as roads, cities, rivers, and political boundaries.

This type of map aims to provide a comprehensive representation of an area, allowing users to orient themselves and plan routes efficiently (e.g., [](#localitymap)).

A topographic map showing the land, street networks, and boundary between Singapore and Malaysia (Johor).

## Thematic map

A **thematic map** (e.g., John Snow's map at [](#choleramap) and urban movement map at [](#clinicflow)) is a visual representation of a specific theme, subject, or data attribute that emphasizes .red.bold[spatial patterns], relationships, or trends within a geographical area.

Through the use of various .red[symbols, colors, or shading], thematic maps visually illustrate the spatial arrangement and distribution of features, revealing the relationships, trends, or correlations that constitute spatial patterns.

Spatial pattern encompasses the way elements are organized, positioned, or clustered in a particular space. By analyzing spatial patterns, researchers can gain valuable insights into underlying processes, trends, or correlations in diverse fields, including geography, ecology, urban planning, and epidemiology.


A **map** is a tool for **storytelling** and a medium for **communication**.
**Spatial patterns** are the **information and insight** we can observe from a (thematic) map.
