# Quadrat Count Analysis

## What is Quadrat Count Analysis?

Quadrat Count Analysis is a method used in spatial point pattern analysis to determine whether a pattern of points is randomly distributed, clustered, or evenly spaced. It involves __dividing the study area into smaller, equal-sized areas called "quadrats"__ (typically square or rectangular in shape) and __counting the number of points fall in each quadrat__.


## Calculating Quadrat Count

The main steps in Quadrat Count Analysis are:
1. Divide the study area into a __grid of quadrats__.
2. __Count__ the number of points in each quadrat.
3. Calculate the __expected number of points__ per quadrat under the assumption of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR).
4. __Compare__ the observed frequency distribution (the counts) with the expected frequency distribution (under CSR) to assess the degree of similarity or difference between them.
5. Apply __statistical tests__, such as the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, to determine whether the observed frequency distribution significantly differs from the expected distribution under CSR---whether the spatial pattern exhibits randomness, clustering, or regularity.

The quadrat method partitions the study region into $r$ rows and $c$ columns, which define $m=r\times c$ non-overlapping subregions or quadrats of equal area. This method relies on the fact that, .red[under CSR, the expected number of observations within any region of equal size is the same]. Let $n$ be the number of observed points, $m$ the number of quadrats of equal size, and $n_i$ the number of points in quadrat $i$. The expected number of points in each quadrat is $N/m$. The test statistic is calculated as

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^m\frac{\text{observed}_i - \text{expected}}{\text{expected}}
$$

$$
\text{expected} = \frac{N}{m}
$$

.bold[Clustered example]
- chi-squared statistic=354.332, p-value=.red[2.606e-66]
- .red[significantly different] from random

.bold[Random example]
- chi-squared statistic=19.332, p-value=0.199
- non-significant; the distribution is .red[not different from random]

.bold[Regular example]
- chi-squared statistic=8.332, pvalue=0.910
- non-significant; the distribution is .red[not different from random]

.xkcd[Since the expected number of points are the average number of points---the test do not consider the spread mathematically---thus the regular example 'is not different from random'. ]

### Key considerations
].column[
Some key considerations in Quadrat Count Analysis include:
- .bold[Quadrat size]: The size of the quadrats should be carefully chosen to ensure that it is appropriate for the scale of the pattern being studied.
- .bold[Quadrat shape]: While square quadrats are common, other shapes (such as rectangular or circular) may be used depending on the specific study requirements.
- .bold[Edge effects]: Care should be taken to account for edge effects, which occur when quadrats at the edge of the study area contain fewer points due to the smaller overlapping area.

Quadrat Count Analysis provides a simple and intuitive approach to analyzing spatial point patterns, but it has some limitations compared to more advanced methods, such as **distance-based** or **density-based** approaches. Nonetheless, it is a useful tool for exploratory analysis and can be helpful in understanding the general characteristics of a spatial point pattern.
