# Geospatial Statistics and Visualization

## Course description

Data visualization is crucial for understanding geographical phenomena, and statistical thinking is essential for effective visualization. This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of geospatial data visualization and analysis techniques. Students will develop a strong foundation in statistical methods and spatial thinking abilities while learning to create compelling visualizations using Python. Key topics include statistical patterns, point patterns, areal patterns, and geovisualization. Through hands-on experience with Python libraries, students will enhance their spatial data science skills. By the end of the course, students will be well-equipped to analyze, visualize, and communicate geospatial data insights effectively.
