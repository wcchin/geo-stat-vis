## Visualization, Map & Spatial Pattern
The comic [](#catprox) is a visualization of the relationship between human proximity to cat and the intelligence of the person.

Visualization is .mark[the process of representing data or information] in a graphical or pictorial form to communicate an idea, concept, or pattern more effectively.

### General purpose map
**General purpose map** (e.g., [](#topomap)) is mainly for wayfinding and navigation, as it displays a wide range of geographical features such as roads, cities, rivers, and political boundaries.

This type of map aims to provide a comprehensive representation of an area, allowing users to orient themselves and plan routes efficiently (e.g., [](#localitymap)).

```


### Thematic map

A **thematic map** (e.g., John Snow's map at [](#choleramap) and urban movement map at [](#clinicflow)) is a visual representation of a specific theme, subject, or data attribute that emphasizes .red.bold[spatial patterns], relationships, or trends within a geographical area.

Through the use of various .red[symbols, colors, or shading], thematic maps visually illustrate the spatial arrangement and distribution of features, revealing the relationships, trends, or correlations that constitute spatial patterns.

Spatial pattern encompasses the way elements are organized, positioned, or clustered in a particular space. By analyzing spatial patterns, researchers can gain valuable insights into underlying processes, trends, or correlations in diverse fields, including geography, ecology, urban planning, and epidemiology.


A **map** is a tool for **storytelling** and a medium for **communication**.
**Spatial patterns** are the **information and insight** we can observe from a (thematic) map.

```

### From Data to Information, then Insights

- **Data**: Raw facts, figures, or observations collected and recorded] in various forms, such as text, numbers, or images. Data is the basic building block for understanding and analyzing phenomena or trends.

- **Information**: Organized, structured, and processed data that provides context and meaning, making it useful and relevant to specific users or situations. Information helps answer questions and guide decision-making.

- **Insights**: Deep, meaningful conclusions and understanding derived from analyzing and interpreting information. Insights uncover patterns, trends, or cause-and-effect relationships, enabling informed decisions and new perspectives.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/drawing-data_info_insight.png
:label: data2insights
:alt: Data, Information, Insights.
:align: center

```

Geovisualisation is a series of explorations and analyses, that includes using various techniques and methods, e.g., thematic mapping, exploratory spatial data analysis, to uncover the underlying patterns, to get better understanding of geographical phenomena.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/drawing-how_maps_are_used.png
:label: cartocube
:alt: Data, Information, Insights.

```

### The Key Steps of Data Visualisation: **OTAS**

- Observe
- Think
- Assess
- Show


```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/otas_01.png
:label: otas01
:alt: Data, Information, Insights.
:align: center

**OTAS**.
```

#### Observe
- **What can be SEEN?**
- Ensure you understand the **metadata**.
- Look into the data.
- Get your hand dirty: **Create relevant plots or maps** using the data.
	- whatever plots/maps that you can think of, sky is the limit
- Look at those plots and maps...
- **Divergent thinking, brainstorming**

#### Think
- **What are the CAUSES?**
- How does it look?
- Are there any **familiar or expected** patterns? (that you may have seen somewhere before)
- Is there anything looks **unusual and strange**? (something that really stands out)
	- Is there anything wrong?
- Are there any **unexpected** patterns? (something beyond your expectation)
	- unexpected patterns are usually the interesting one, if they are real
	- counter-intuitive
- What could be the **possible reasons** behind these patterns?
- **Expanding and synthesizing from the brainstorming step**


#### Assess

- **How to VERIFY them?**
- Review and (re)evaluate your **initial ideas or thoughts**, even if they seem **immature, unconventional, or funny**.
- **Test your hypotheses or thoughts** to ensure their validity.
- Double-check for any possible *(stupid) mistakes* made during
	- data processing,
	- calculation,
	- unit transformation,
	- map projection, or
	- visualization.
- **Literature review** for confirmation/contrasting the findings.
- **Convergent thinking, rigourously evaluating every idea**


#### Show
- **How to VISUALISE them?**
- **(Re)Drawing** the plots & maps
- Think about the **layouts**
	- potrait, landscape
	- combining multiple subplots
	- sequences
	- colours
	- text font family, size, and positions
- **Show** it to people
- **Communicate** based on it
- Getting **feedbacks**

#### OTAS Flow

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/otas_flow.png
:label: otasflow
:alt: The workflow of OTAS.
:align: center

OTAS workflow.
```

#### Summary

- There is **no strict rules** for doing data visualisation
- The four OTAS steps are just a quick guideline for the **"visual thinking process"**
	- Observe: divergent thinking & brainstorming
	- Think: extending & synthesing
	- Assess: convergent thinking & double checking
	- Show: presentation
- **Some people skip the Think and Assess** steps and jump from drawing initial plots/maps step to the last showing/communicating step.
	- Their results could be bias, not comprehensively capture the thoughts

## Statistical Thinking

### What is statistics?
From data to information.

The two main types of statistics:

1. **Descriptive Statistics** is about __how we describe data__. This branch focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation. Descriptive statistics helps **visualize** and **interpret** data through graphical methods like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and maps.

2. **Inferential Statistics** is about __what we can learn from the data__. This branch involves drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample by using probability theory. Inferential statistics allows us to **make predictions**, **<u>test hypotheses</u>**, and **evaluate the reliability** of conclusions. Some common methods in inferential statistics include regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.

#### Descriptive Statistics
The three types of measures in descriptive statistics
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: These measures provide an indication of the "center" or "middle" of a dataset. They include: mean, median, mode.
- **Measures of Spread** (Variability): These measures describe how spread out or dispersed the data is. They include: range, variance, standard deviation.
- **Measures of Shape**: These measures help characterize the shape or distribution of the data, including: skewness, kurtosis.

**Measures of Central Tendency**  
help us understand the central or 'average' values in a dataset.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/measures_central.png
:label: centraltend
:alt: Central Tendency
:align: center

```


**Measures of Spread**  
(variability) describe how the data is spread or dispersed around the central values.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/measures_spread.png
:label: spread
:alt: Measuring Spread
:align: center

The spread of the three IRIS species.
```


**Measures of Shape**  
describe the shape of the distribution, which could be steep/flat, skewed, or non-normal.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/measures_shapes.png
:label: shape
:alt: steep or flat
:align: center

The skewness and kurtosis of the three IRIS species.
```



#### Inferential Statistics

- **Analysis of Relationship**:
How one variable is related to another? How a series of independent variables could be related to one of the dependent variables?
- **Analysis of Differences**:
Are them significantly different?
- **Analysis of Confidence**:
How confident are we about the sampling result?


**Analysis of Relationship**:  
Assessing the strength and direction of associations between variables. Examples include correlation (Pearson's r for parametric data and Spearman's rho for non-parametric data), and regression analysis (linear, multiple, and logistic regression). These output could further be used for further analysis and predictions.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/analysis_correlation.png
:label: relationshpi
:alt: relationship
:align: center

The relationships between petal length and petal weight for the three IRIS species.
```


**Analysis of Differences**:  
Evaluating whether observed differences between groups or conditions are statistically significant. Hypothesis testing forms the foundation for these measures. Parametric tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, are used when data meets certain assumptions (e.g., normality). Non-parametric tests, such as Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Kruskal-Wallis test, are used when assumptions are violated or with non-normal data.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/analysis_differences-b.png
:label: difference
:alt: analysis of differences
:align: center

The differences in petal length between the three species.
```


**Analysis of Confidence**:  
Provide insights into the reliability and generalizability of statistical findings. Estimation involves calculating point estimates and confidence intervals to infer .red[population] parameters. Sampling distributions and standard errors help quantify the variability of sample statistics. Statistical power and effect size measures ensure that studies have adequate sample sizes and detect meaningful effects.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/analysis_confidence.png
:label: confidence
:alt: analysis of confidence
:align: center

The confidence interval (CI) of the actual population mean could fall within the 95% CI.
```



#### Summary
Thinking **Statistically** while doing **Geospatial Visualization**

- Measures of **Central Tendency & Spreads**: Spatial Aggregation---
What is the median resale price of HDB flats in each district?

- Measures of **Shape**: Data Categorization---
Which data breaking scheme is more appropriate for mapping the variable?
Is data transformation needed?

- Analysis of **Relationship**: Spatial Interaction---
Is mental wellness related to the distribution of greenery?
Can Socio-Economic Status be explained or predicted by the distribution of various types of POIs and property prices?

- Analysis of **Differences**: Spatial Patterns---
Are there significant clusters of crime cases in the study area?
Are the spatial patterns of university-level and secondary-school-level residences different from each other?

- Analysis of **Confidence**: Samples vs. Population---
Is the sample data representative of the population?

These are some of the key concerns when we are reading/mapping a spatial pattern.

## Key Components of Maps

- Sizes
- Typography
- Colors
- Coordinate System
- Arrangement


#### Sizes
The size of the map:
- a 'full' width figure in an A4 paper (e.g., thesis, reports)
- a 'half' width figure in an A4 paper  
(i.e., to fit in one column of a two columns layout)
- as one of the element inside an A1 poster
- a full A0 poster-size map
- in a Powerpoint slide (full-page vs. as an element)

**Map details**
How much detail can be shown in:
- a small A4-one-column map
- a full A0 poster-size map

Two thinking directions:
- What should be added --- the 'plus'
- What should be removed --- the 'minus'


**DPI**  
(dots-per-inch): the number of dots that will be drawn or printed within a one-inch span (in a single dimension).

**Think:**
- What happens when you put an A0-size map/image inside an A4 paper?
- How does a 2cm line in the original A0 map look on the A4 paper?

**Take home message**:  
Always plan ahead about what size of map to be drawn.

```{figure} ./resources/w01-img/drawing_sizes_1b.png
:label: zoomin
:alt: zoom in
:align: center

```


#### Typography

Typography most often serves to label cartographic elements.
It is a **“functional symbol”** primarily, and secondarily an __aesthetic element​__ meaning that __it carries cartographic meaning​__ and **is not simply “window dressing”**.

.footnote-right[[.square[(Typography, from Making Effective Maps: Cartographic Visualization for GIS)]](https://colorado.pressbooks.pub/makingmaps/chapter/typography/)]

- Font Family (Serif, Sans-Serif, Decorative, Monospaced)
- Font Size (relative to map size)
- Font Weight (Bold (700) vs. Regular (400) vs. Light (300))
- Font style (italic vs. regular)
- Uppercase, lowercase, title case

*What is the differences between Sans Serif fonts and Serif fonts?*

<img src="resources/w01-img/text_elements.png" width="70%" align="center">
.square[Text elements. ]

Things to be considered:
- **Visibility**: make sure the labels can be viewed without zoom-in.
- **Hierarchy**: use different sizes, weights, or styles to show hierarchy of labels.
- **Consistency**: use the same typeface to show labels in the same level.
- **License**: make sure the font can be used in your targeted publication or is there any restriction/subscription-needed
- **Publication requirement**: some journal requested that some specific fonts should be used for some of the map elements.

**Take home message**:
The top priority is to ensure that the text is *clear and readable*. Additionally, make sure the fonts are appropriate for your target venue.

#### Colors

In the realm of cartography and geovisualization, color is an essential tool that serves to delineate different components and highlight their significance, thereby facilitating effective visual communication. In designing geovisualization, *the application of color goes beyond aesthetics, as it enables the clear differentiation of features and allows for the accurate representation of data*, making it a crucial aspect of geovisualization design.

Things to considered while selecting color(s):
- The targeted  audiences or venues: color or black and white (and grey)?, colorblind? etc....

- Types of values:
    - Qualitative/Categorical
    - Quantitative/Sequential:
        - discrete: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4; levels after 'breaks'; age groups...
        - continuous: scaled data from 0 to 1, with a min-value and max-value, exact age...
    - Diverging: with a center value (e.g., 0)

Two basic color models:
- **CMYK**: allows for more precise control over how colors appear on printed materials.
    - four integer values ranging from 0 to 100, each value corresponding to the percentage of ink coverage for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK components.
- **RGB**: allows for precise control over how colors appear on digital devices.
    - three integer values ranging from 0 to 255, each value corresponding to the intensity of the Red, Green, and Blue lights.

How to use colors in Python (Matplotlib):
- named colors: `'red'`, `'blue'`, `'green'`, `'white'`, [full list here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html)
- xkcd colors: `'xkcd:off white'`, [full list here](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/)
- specifying R, G, & B in the ranging from 0 to 1 (divided by 255): `(0.1, 0.2, 0.5)`
- specifying R, G, B, & alpha in the ranging from 0 to 1 (alpha as proportion): `(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7)`
- specifying RGB hex code: `'#0f0f0f'`
- specifying RGBA hex code: `'#0f0f0fff'`


#### Coordinate System

].column[.justify[
All maps are drawn with a specific coordinate reference system (CRS), which defines how the geographic coordinates of features on the Earth's surface are represented in a flat, two-dimensional plane (i.e., map). There are two main types of CRS: unprojected and projected.

1. **Unprojected CRS**

   - Uses latitude (N-S) and longitude (E-W) coordinates in degrees.
   - Represents Earth's curved surface.

2. **Projected CRS**

   - Transforms Earth's curved surface into a flat map (in length, e.g. meters).
   - Different types:
     - **Mercator**: Preserves angles and directions, used in navigation.
     - **Equal Area**: Preserves area, useful for spatial analysis.
     - **Conic**: Preserves shape and angles, used for mid-latitude regions.

   Each map projection serves different purposes and has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of preserving shape, area, distance, and direction. The choice of projection depends on the specific needs and applications of the map.

#### How to use CRS in Python

```python
import geopandas as gpd
# read the file
singapore = gpd.read_file('../path_to_file/singapore.shp')
print(singapore.crs)  # to show the projection info from the saved file

# use .to_crs() to convert between projections, usually from or to EPSG:4326

# check EPSG.io website, 3414 is the code for SVY21 / Singapore TM,
# TM means Transverse Mercator, see https://epsg.io/3414 for details
sg_prjd = singapore.to_crs('epsg:3414')
# OR
## find the targeted crs string, something look like this:
targeted_crs = '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=1.36666666666667 +lon_0=103.833333333333 +k=1 +x_0=28001.642 +y_0=38744.572 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs +type=crs'
