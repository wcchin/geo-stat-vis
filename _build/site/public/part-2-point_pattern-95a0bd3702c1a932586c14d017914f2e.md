# Chapter 3: Point Pattern

**Objectives of this lecture**

- Understand what is '.bold[Complete Spatial Randomness]' and '.bold[Spatial Patterns]'



### Two Types Clustering in Spatial Analysis

1. some parts of the study area that have very high concentration of point events, i.e., .red['clusters']
    - to check if this phenomenon exists in the spatial point data
    - to identify the location of these clusters
    - significant tests, CSR

2. groups of spatial points that are close to each other, i.e., .red['clusters']
    - identify grouping of points with/without overlap
