# Chapter 4: Global Point Pattern

**Objectives of this lecture**

- Understand what is '**Complete Spatial Randomness**' and '**Spatial Patterns**'
- To learn how to identify Clustering Pattern
    - Grid-based, counting: Quadrat Count Analysis
    - Distance-based, sorting: Nearest Neighbor Analysis
    - Distance-based, searching: Ripley's K-function(s)
- Monte-Carlo Simulation



## Two Types Clustering in Spatial Analysis

1. some parts of the study area that have very high concentration of point events, i.e., _'clusters'_
    - to check if this phenomenon exists in the spatial point data
    - to identify the location of these clusters
    - significant tests, CSR

2. groups of spatial points that are close to each other, i.e., _'clusters'_
    - identify grouping of points with/without overlap

How to differentiate clustered from random **(CSR)**?
