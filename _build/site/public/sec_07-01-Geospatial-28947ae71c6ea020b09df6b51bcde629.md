### Geospatial Data Storytelling
#### Key characteristics
].column[

- .bold[Geographic Data]: Geospatial data storytelling relies on geographic data, which includes any information associated with a specific location. This data can be either .red[vector] (e.g., points, lines, and polygons) or .red[raster] (e.g., aerial imagery and satellite data) and often includes attributes that describe the features' characteristics.

- .bold[Locations & Maps]: Maps are a central component of geospatial data storytelling, serving as the canvas on which data is visualized and stories are told. They provide a .red[spatial context for the narrative], helping audiences understand the relative location, distribution, and relationships between various geographic features.

- .bold[Spatial Relationships]: A key aspect of geospatial data storytelling is the focus on spatial relationships, such as .red[proximity, connectivity, and overlap between geographic features]. These relationships can reveal patterns and trends that would otherwise be difficult to identify, enabling more informed decision-making.
