# Chapter 2: Statistical Pattern

**Objectives of this lecture**

- To know the basic steps of .bold[data preparation]
- To learn about .bold[frequency distribution] and how to visualize the data based on frequency distribution
- To learn about .bold[data transformation] techniques and when to use it
- To learn about .bold[data classification] and key things to consider when classifying data
- To know how to measure and visualize differences
- To learn t-test and when to use it
- To learn ANOVA and when to use it
- To learn non-parametric tests and when to use them



### Summary and key points
].column[
- Hypothesis testing is a key to quantify the differences in data.
- Null hypothesis are usually 'no effects' or 'no differences'.  
- T-test, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests could be used in various conditions. 
- T-test and ANOVA were designed with some assumptions and base distribution (t-distribution and F-distribution), which are prefered if the assumptions are met. 
- If the assumptions are violated, the statistical estimation is compromised and the accuracy is unknown. 
- Non-parametric tests can be used in that situation.

### How to think statistically?
].column[
Some key points:
- How to measure data quantitatively (or qualitatively)
    - nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
    - binary, numerical, categorical 
- Are them different? Are them same?
    - designing the hypothesis
    - how to formulate a question
- Are them related? 
    - correlation, regression (not covered)
- How to test/assess the hypothesis?
    - parametric, non-parametric
    - the assumptions behind each method
- How to read the results (interpretation)?
    - significant at what level? 
    - effect size? 
    - how confidence are we?
- Relating to the big picture
    - what this means in your big-aim / Reseearch Questions (RQ)
    - how visualisation can help linking back to your study

### Strategies to investigate spatial data differences

- .red[individual level] comparison
    - directly analyzing the data table
    - transactions between flat types, between regions, between time, ...  
    - each data point is considered independent from other data point
    - use statistical methods

- .red[spatially aggregated] comparison
    - aggregate the data by spatial units (subzone, planning area)
    - the average price for 4 rooms for every subzone, ...
    - each spatial unit is considered independent from other spatial unit
    - use statistical methods

- consider .red[spatial relationship] (nearby) effects
    - spatial relationship between data points or spatial units
    - the prices of the same type of house unit within the neighborhood (a search distance)... 
    - data points or spatial units are consider spatially dependent
    - use spatial statistic methods
