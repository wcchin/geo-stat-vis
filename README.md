# Geospatial Statistics and Visualisation: A Jupyter Book

This website is a Jupyter book (2.0) project, based on all the materials in my GE5230 course (with the same course name) for the MSc in Applied GIS, Department of Geography, National University of Singapore.

The materials are converted from the Markdown file that I use to create the slides (using pyremark, a Python interface for remark.js slides).

This website serve the purpose of facilitating the teaching and learning process, and aims to promote the Geospatial and GIScience studies.

The idea to combine statistics and visualisation is because Scientific Visualisation is mostly data-driven and data-proven---these processes cannot exists without the fooundation in Statistics. And this applied to Geospatial Visualisation.

This is the version 0.1 of the Jupyter Book website. As of now:

- 2025/11/17 - After 3 days of setting & processing, only Chapter 1--3 are converted (cleaned the slides syntax). Main text of these chapters are still not there, only the materials are processed. Chapter 4--6 are unprocessed (copied from the slides).
- 2025/11/25 - Restructured the content folder structure, to put the sections into separated chapter folders. Split Chapter 4 into 2 chapter (4 and 5), now we have 7 chapters in total. Completed Chapter 4 and front content of chapter 5, next thing is 5-1 KDE.
